# Project
 
This project is a website designed to assist in the completion of the New York Times Wordle and Sudoku puzzles. It uses python algorithms to efficiently find solutions to both Wordle and Sudoku puzzles. It has additional pages that allow a visitor to the website to compete against the algorithm solving random Wordle puzzles, or the daily Wordle puzzle. A version of the website that does not contain the Sudoku portion is hosted at:
